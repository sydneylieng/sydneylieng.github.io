# The Now.

My name is Sydney Lieng and I am currently finishing my last year of Software Engineering at McMaster University. 
 
It's been a solid five years, but I'm ready to seek new challenges!

# The Career Journey.

## Server
### Sunset Grill
### July 2011 – Sept 2016
I worked here for about five years and I couldn't have asked for a better place to start. I learned so much about the customer service industry and wouldn't be the person I am today. 
I learned how to be socialable and how to interact with the different types of customers. I also was able to learn how it was working with others in a high-paced environment. 

## Wallingford Hall Resprestative
### Inter-Residence Council
### August 2013 – May 2014
Even before I started university, I wanted to find a way to get involved! I found a position on a council that helped students get through their first year on residence. 
I myself haven't experienced it yet, but I knew being the person I am, I could have make a big impact! 
During this job, I coordinated and attended meetings to advocate for 3700 students in residence. I also assisted in planning hall and residence-wide programs. 
This job allowed me to meet so many different people and learn so much more about McMaster.

## Student Engineer
###Stahlsmidst Cable and SystemI
### May – August 2015
I was able to score a summer position at this company as a Student Engineer. My main job was to assist the Quality Engineer with all her duties. This includes ensuring all products meet the standard requirements and creating documentation for it. I also created packaging outlines for new program cables given clients' specifications. I developed insight on mechanical testing, such as Stroke Loss, Efficiency and Routing Loss, as well as how to present and communicate the information tested to clients. 
It was a lot of new experiences packed into one summer, but from this, I got a good look at how the automotive industry works!

## CAD Specialist
### Teknion
### May 2016 – July 2017
For my co-op, I thankfully got hired at Teknion as a CAD Specialist. This position gave me a big insight of how corporate companies work. For a company that creates high-end office furniture, there are a lot complexity within the company. 
For my position, I was in the Marketing and Sales. I was responsible for desiging and developing CAD symbols and Installation Guides that represent Teknion products as a graphical representation used in the sales process. 
There were a lot of manual work when it comes to creating CAD symbols. To quicken one of the checking processes I developed Excel and AutoCAD scripts that automated it. This project can be found on the my project page called Entity Checker.
